Analysis:

If you’re hunting for a book in our little memory-catalog, you’ve got two main moves. First up, the old-school linear search. It just plods along, eyeballing every single book until it stumbles on the right one. Super simple, works no matter how messy your list is, but man, it’s slow if you’ve got a ton of books—like, it’ll check each one, so the bigger the pile, the longer you’re waiting. Classic O(n) slog.
Now, if you’re feeling fancy and your catalog’s already sorted by title, you can use binary search. Picture it as a game of “hot or cold” where you always guess the middle book, then ditch half the list each time. That’s O(log n) speed—way snappier if you’re swimming in books. But, and here’s the catch, you gotta pay the price to keep that thing sorted (which takes effort, O(n log n), or at least be ready to tidy up every time you add or yank out a book).
So, which one’s your wingman? Well, if your list is tiny or you’re always adding and ditching books, just stick with linear. No need to overcomplicate things. But if your library’s massive and doesn’t change much? Binary search all the way. In real life, of course, you’d probably just use a hash map (because, duh, instant lookups) or even some fancy full-text search if you want to get clever with partial titles or rankings. But hey, at the end of the day, it’s all about that O(n) vs O(log n) grind. Pick your poison.
